c0pe8 Linux
===========

Just booting a Linux from bare kernel and busybox (name doesn't matters, does it ?)

[+] Building (from script)
--------------------------

	> Takes around 20-30 mins
	
	[*] pre-reqs:
		- for compiling kernel
			- simply uncomment line 7 in build.sh
		- emulator
			- QEMU [ sudo apt-get install qemu-system ]
			
	[*] building:
		- simply run ./build.sh [ ./build.sh ]
			- builds kernel[bzImage] and initrd.img inside /build
			
	[*] karnel-panic:
		- run what u build with ./run.sh [ ./run.sh ]

[+] skip building
-----------------
	
	> already compiled and built kernel, initrd.img (inside /build)
	- skip building and simply run ./run.sh [ ./run.sh ]

[!] To-Do
---------

	- Add more compiled-binaries (especially gcc)
